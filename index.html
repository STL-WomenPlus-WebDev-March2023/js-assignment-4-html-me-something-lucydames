            <p>Brooke, 42, is the quintessential oldest daughter, our fearless leader. She lives in Colorado and enjoys surfing, snowboarding, cooking, gardening and traveling the world. Brooke is currently an elementary school teacher, she loves her second grade kids! She is the mom of our first and only awesome nephew Holden, who is 13 and going into eighth grade. He loves to ski, surf, skateboard, golf, and mess around with spray paint. I admire Brooke deeply for her strength in the face of adversity and the kindness she carries wherever she may go. She is bossy in the best way, tough but caring. She has the prettiest green eyes and makes the best steak. I have loved watching her raise such a wonderful kid and pursue her passions.</p>

            <p>Lauren, 40, is endearingly described as the renaissance woman of our team. As the second born, she has paved the gallant way for leading with your heart and trying new things. Lauren also lives in Colorado and has recently started her own electrical engineering company, Electric Dames LLC! She enjoys camping, hiking, philosophy, DIY projects, and lifting heavy shit. Her talents can only be described as boundless and badass. I admire Lauren for her resilience, she is the mighty phoenix who rises from the ashes time and time again. Not to sound bias, but I don’t think I’ve ever met a funnier individual in my life. Her smile is radiant and when she laughs I feel so lucky to know her.</p>

            <p>Me, 26, the perfect balance of older and younger. Due to the large age gap between Brooke/Lauren and myself, I strongly identify as an older sibling. But I also have the luxury of falling into a younger sibling role too! I currently work at Salon Fleur de Lis as head of guest relations and was born and raised in St. Louis. I enjoy all things comedy and have had a passion for improv since I was in middle school. I love to write, cook, take hot girl walks, and puzzles. I like to think that my role in our sisterhood is comparable to the glue, not to say that I always hold everything together, but I often bridge the gaps between us. I strive to honor all of my sisters in the things that I do and the person I am because what great inspiration I have!</p>

            <p>Emma, 24. The middle child to her core. She is my first friend and my best friend, and I have the privilege of being her roommate. She loves children and is currently a preschool teacher. Emma enjoys reading, french cuisine, singing like Liza Mineli in the shower, pulling off a red lip, and baking pastries. As a newborn, she slept 22 hours a day. As an adult, her greatest joy is dropping her bag on the floor after work and taking a glorious afternoon snooze. Whether it’s at a stoplight or in the aisles of Target, she is the kind of person people kindly approach. If you need someone in your corner, Emma the cheerleader will show up every time. I have never met someone who loves so authentically. Her eyes are sapphire blue and her heart is pure gold.</p>

            <p>Even at the age of 21, Eliza is an exemplary baby. She is the youngest child blueprint and we love her dearly for it. Eliza is currently in school studying to be a history teacher. She enjoys animals of all kinds, fashion, Taylor Swift, dancing in public, and Facetime you in the middle of a work day until you pick up. She will order the most expensive thing on the menu then stare you down with her gorgeous hazel eyes. But she is profoundly empathetic and her devotion and warmth shines through everything she does. Eliza does not tolerate unkind people and has taught me to advocate for myself in many ways. She asks for help when she needs it and is always there to listen, patiently. Even though we joke about her role in the family, her presence is calm and wise and absolutely vital.</p>
